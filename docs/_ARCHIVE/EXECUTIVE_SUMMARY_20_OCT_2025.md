## 🎯 The Situation

### Problem
The Archivio Comunicazioni (Communications Archive) page was broken:
- Desktop layout: Grid was disordered
- Mobile layout: Single column broken

- Overall UX: Completely unusable

### Root Cause
Archive.php and SCSS were completely rewritten this morning, introducing multiple breaking changes to the responsive design.

- **Files 3-4**: comunicazioni-filter.js, comunicazione-card.php - Preserved (untouched)

### Preservation
- ✅ AJAX handler intact
- ✅ Security fixes (nonce, sanitization, escaping) - 100% intact
- ✅ Breadcrumb + back button (PROMPT 5) - Intact
- ✅ Skip meme posts - Intact
- ✅ Lazy loading - Intact
